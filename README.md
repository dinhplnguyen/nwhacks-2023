Sipwise is a Web Application that helps user keep track of their water intake and stay hydrated through the day.

It can be difficult to tell how much water we really should be drinking throughout the day. Traditional advice of having '8 glasses a day' did not take into account differences in weight, activity level, water content through rest of diet (food and drinks), or even the general climate around the person ^1. Going by thirst is a better indicator, but people may still want to improve their hydration levels. 

This tool was made to simplify that process somewhat

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install Sipwise.

```bash
# install npm packages
npm install

# run the project on port localhost:3000
cd monitor
npm run start
```

## Usage
Create an account to keep personal weight and water intake calculation 

## Language and Tools
- HTML5 / CSS / JS
- ReactJs
- Firebase Database / Authentication / Domain Hosting

## Issue
*Last update Jan 22, 2023*

- The weight fetching from Firebase Database is not consistent through the application.
- Water intake calculation was not delivered as expected
